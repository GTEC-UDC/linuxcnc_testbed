.. Robot Grúa documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Wed Nov 20 19:58:07 2024.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

   Note
   Section headers (ref) are created by underlining (and optionally overlining)
   the section title with a punctuation character, at least as long as the text.
   See https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#sections

   We follow the characters suggested in the Sphinx documentation:
       # with overline, for parts
       * with overline, for chapters
       = for sections
       - for subsections
       ^ for subsubsections
       " for paragraphs
